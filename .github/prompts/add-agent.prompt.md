# Add or Verify Agent

Classify user intent first, then execute the matching flow:

- **Create** — User describes a new agent to add → Execute Flow C (Extend)
- **Verify** — User points to an existing agent (with its skill, instruction, prompt files) and asks to verify, audit, or check consistency → Execute Verify flow

When intent is ambiguous, check whether the user referenced existing files or described a new workflow. If still unclear, ask one clarifying question.

## Standard User-Facing Progress

1. Refresh Copilot documentation
2. Analyze the codebase
3. Assess and choose bundle architecture (Create) or evaluate target agent (Verify)
4. Ask targeted follow-up only if needed
5. Generate or update the bundle (Create) or fix and improve the target agent (Verify)
6. Audit and iterate until PASS
7. Deliver the final result

Phase 4 auto-skips when analysis provides enough context.

## Create Flow

Describe the agent you want to add below. Include: workflow or role, target users, key tasks, and autonomy constraints.

### Execution Steps

1. **Refresh docs** — Fetch current Copilot documentation. Validate mandatory source URLs. Produce in-session refresh brief.
2. **Analyze** — Scan existing agents, skills, instructions, prompts. Understand conventions the new agent must follow. Identify overlap/gaps.
3. **Assess** — Current ecosystem shape, overlap risks, integration needs, conductor routing changes if needed.
4. **Clarify only if needed** — Ask minimum targeted questions for missing critical facts.
5. **Generate** — Create new agent with: no role overlap, consistent naming, project-derived prefix, real conventions, supporting files (skill, instruction, prompt, template) when needed.
6. **Audit** — All dimensions + ecosystem coherence. If `REVISE`, fix until `PASS`.
7. **Deliver** — Assessment, agent file(s), integration guide, changes needed to existing agents.

Final quality expectation: zero open findings (including minor) and zero editor diagnostics in generated or updated agent files before completion.

If the repository has unrelated changes, preserve them and continue unless there is a direct file-path conflict.

### Example

> Add a performance profiling agent that helps identify and fix memory leaks, excessive CPU usage, and slow UI rendering in SwiftUI views.

## Verify Flow

Point to an existing agent and its associated files (skill, instruction, prompt). The kit will verify consistency, quality, and effectiveness against agent kit standards.

### Execution Steps

1. **Refresh docs** — Fetch current Copilot documentation. Validate mandatory source URLs. Produce in-session refresh brief.
2. **Collect target** — Identify the agent file and all associated files (skill, instruction, prompt, template) the user wants verified. Read every file fully.
3. **Analyze ecosystem** — Scan the rest of the project's agents and conventions to understand the context the target agent operates in.
4. **Evaluate** — Check the target agent and its associated files against the audit rubric:
   - Frontmatter validity and description discoverability
   - Role clarity, mission, non-goals, output contract
   - Scope discipline and `applyTo` narrowness
   - Cross-reference integrity between agent ↔ skill ↔ instruction ↔ prompt
   - Naming consistency with project conventions
   - Apple platform specificity where applicable
   - Overlap or conflict with other agents in the ecosystem
   - Behavioral pattern correctness per SKILL.md artifact requirements
5. **Fix** — Propose concrete fixes for every finding. Apply fixes with user approval. Do not skip minor findings.
6. **Audit** — Run full audit on the corrected files. If `REVISE`, fix and re-audit until `PASS`.
7. **Deliver** — Summary of findings, changes made, remaining risks, and ecosystem coherence status.

### Example

> Verify my Swift Testing agent — check if `swift-testing.agent.md`, its skill in `skills/swift-testing/SKILL.md`, and instruction `swift-testing.instructions.md` are consistent and follow kit best practices.
