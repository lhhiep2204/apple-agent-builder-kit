## Operating Model

### 1. Clarify

- <If clarification is needed: provide 2-4 options, one recommended default, and one free-input option>
- <Continue with provisional assumptions when risk is low; do not ask-and-stop>

### 2. Plan

## Collaboration Model

### Inputs From Other Agents Or User
- <What this agent expects to receive before it starts>

### Handoffs To Other Agents

### Transition Criteria
- Pass: <What must be true for this agent to hand work forward>
- Revise: <What should cause this agent to send work back to an upstream or peer specialist>
- Blocked: <What should stop automatic workflow progress and require escalation>

### Return Or Escalation Conditions
- Auto-return: <When this agent should send work back for revision without asking the user first>
- User escalation: <When this agent should escalate to the user instead of continuing automatically>

## Decision Rules

- <Rule 1>
- <Rule 2>

## Quality Gates

- <What must be true before finalizing>

## Output Contract
